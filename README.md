# MazeSolver-Project
The Maze Solver project is a Java-based application developed using Java Swing and JFrame, implementing a Depth First algorithm to solve mazes. 
This project aims to provide an interactive solution for navigating through complex mazes, finding the shortest path from the start to the end point.


Key Features:

Java Swing User Interface: The application utilizes Java Swing and JFrames to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
Users can interact with the maze, visualize the solving process, and observe the shortest path.

Depth First Algorithm: The project employs the Depth First algorithm, a widely-used graph traversal algorithm, to solve mazes. 
This algorithm explores paths in a systematic manner, backtracking when it encounters dead ends, until it finds the exit.

Maze Generation: The application generates random mazes, providing users with a variety of maze layouts to solve. 
Users can also import their own maze layouts for the solver to navigate.

Interactive Solving Process: Users can observe the step-by-step solving process as the algorithm traverses the maze. 
The application highlights the current path being explored, enabling users to follow along and understand the algorithm's progress.

Shortest Path Visualization: Upon solving the maze, the application highlights the shortest path from the start to the end point. 
This allows users to visualize the most efficient route through the maze.

The Maze Solver project offers an engaging and interactive experience for maze enthusiasts and problem-solving enthusiasts alike. 
By utilizing the Depth First algorithm and a user-friendly Java Swing interface, users can navigate complex mazes and witness the solving process in action. Whether for educational purposes or recreational challenges, this application provides an intuitive solution to maze navigation and exploration.
